# hello-world
I am Adrian Pena, a person who empathizes like a musician, solves problems like an engineer,
and moves through the world like an athlete.

### Why am I on git-hub?
 1. To share my code developed during my masters research for advancement in urban weather monitoring and forecasting.
 2. To join the developer community as I endeavour into building predictive sports-models and become part of the sustainability and resiliency movement.
